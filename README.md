# Image-Steganography

Steganography is defined by hiding a secret message within a non-secret message or object, this project is a simple encoder/decoder which is able to hide text in a image file.

The encoder is used to hide the actual text in the image, as you can see in the encoder there are 2 image files. One is a blank image and one is already encoded. To execute the encoder, adjust the file paths to whatever image you want and give the program a message to encode.


DECODER NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
